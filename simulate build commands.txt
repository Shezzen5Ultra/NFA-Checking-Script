To Make the Script Executable: In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command to make it executable

chmod +x simulate.py

Alternatively- you can install pyinstaller using the following command then use it to do the conversion:

pip install pyinstaller

then navigate to the directory with your python script and execute the following command:

pyinstaller --onefile simulate.py
