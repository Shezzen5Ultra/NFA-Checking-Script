Make the remove.py script executable in linux shell: In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command using bash shell to make it executable-

chmod +x remove.py

alternatively, you can use the python terminal to run this command to convert it into an executable:

start by installing pyinstaller

pip install pyinstaller

Then continue to the conversion process using the command

pyinstaller --onefile nfa_converter.py


This file can then be run from the linux shell as required
